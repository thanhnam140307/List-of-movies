# List of movies

This project was created at the end of 2024 as a final project for the first session at C�gep Saint-Foy. 

## Program Description  

In this program, you can manipulate a list of movies by adding and deleting existing ones. It was written during my first session at C�gep Saint-Foy. Some of the code was prewritten by the teachers, including the tests, file handling code, the Movies class, and anything related to the list. The only code that I wrote is in Programs.cs, which does not contain comments.

Enjoy the code!
